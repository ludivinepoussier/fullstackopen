# fullstackopen
## by Ludivine Poussier

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from the Course [Full
Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about), held by the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/computer-science) at the University of
Helsinki, Finland.

This repository is organized in a way each directory correspond to a _part_ of
the Course.

The exercises of the third part can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/ludivinepoussier/fullstackopen-backend).
